**Indian Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**
This project develops a robust and accurate Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system for Indian vehicles. The system uses a deep learning model to first detect the number plate in an image and then applies an advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine to read the text.

**🚀 Features**
Number Plate Detection: Uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to accurately locate number plates in diverse images.

High Accuracy: The model is trained on a consolidated dataset from Kaggle and Roboflow, ensuring high performance on real-world images.

Optimized OCR: Employs EasyOCR, a powerful OCR library, to extract text from the detected number plates, outperforming traditional OCR methods like pytesseract.

Modular Pipeline: The system is built in a modular fashion, allowing for easy updates and improvements to both the detection and recognition components.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics): The core object detection model for locating number plates.

EasyOCR: A state-of-the-art OCR library for character recognition.

Roboflow & Kaggle: Data sources for a large, diverse dataset of Indian number plates.

OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks.

Python: The primary programming language.

**🧠 Methodology**
Data Consolidation: We combined data from two primary sources: a sample dataset from Kaggle and a larger, pre-annotated dataset from Roboflow. This was crucial to overcome the limitations of a small dataset and prevent model overfitting.

Data Cleaning: The datasets had different class labels and were imbalanced (more images than labels). We implemented a Python script to correct the class IDs and delete all images that lacked a corresponding annotation file. This ensured a perfectly balanced dataset for training.

Model Training: A pre-trained YOLOv8n model was fine-tuned on the cleaned, consolidated dataset for 50 epochs.

Inference & Recognition: The final trained model is used to predict the location of a number plate. The cropped image of the number plate is then passed to EasyOCR for highly accurate text extraction.

To run the project, you need to set up your environment with the necessary libraries. After that, you can use the final inference script to detect and recognize number plates in your own images.
